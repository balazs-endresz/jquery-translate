#summary $( ).nodesContainingText([opt])
#labels Featured

This method method returns the deepest elements containing textnodes.
If an element contains textnodes and other elements too then its .html() will be returned.

==Options==
Override defaults with: `$.fn.nodesContainingText.defaults = {}`

 * not: ''
   * a selector - elements to leave out (script and noscript tags will be omitted either this is set or not)
 * async: false
   * this prevents the browser from freezing on larger sites by executing each filtering iteration with a delay
   * you can set the length of the delay in ms, setting it true means 2 ms

 * each: function(){}
   * arguments: i, DOMelement, containing text
 * complete: function(){}
   * arguments: array`<DOMelement>`, array`<containing text>`
