#summary $( ).nodesContainingText([opt])
#labels Featured

This method method returns the deepest elements containing textnodes.
If an element contains textnodes and other elements too then its .html() will be returned.

==Options==
Override defaults with `$.fn.nodesContainingText.defaults`

 * not: ''
   * selector - elements to leave out (script, noscript, style, object and iframe elements will be omitted either this is set or not)
   * doesn't work for elements having textnode siblings, as their parent node will be returned
 * async: false
   * this prevents the browser from freezing on larger sites by executing each filtering iteration with a delay
   * you can set the length of the delay in ms, setting it true means 2 ms
 * altAndVal: true
   * get the `alt` and `:button,:text,:reset`'s `value` attribute too 
   * (useful when translating text/html with the `subject:true` option, because these don't have any textnodes, so they can be processed and translated along with other nodes)


 * each: function(){}
   * arguments: i, DOMelement, containing text
 * complete: function(){}
   * arguments: array`<DOMelement>`, array`<containing text>`
