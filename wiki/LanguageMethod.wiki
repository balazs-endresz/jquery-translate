#summary $( ).language([options])

*REMOVED IN VERSION 1.3! See release notes for details.*

Here new requests are sent for each element and their children won't be added to the jQuery object as in .translate().
as of v1.1: behaves like the translate method

==Options==

Override defaults with: `$.fn.language.defaults={}`

The result object: http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/reference.html#detectResult


 * setLangAttr: true
   * true: lang attribute
   * string: this attribute will be set
   * false: don't set any attribute
 * subject: true
   * true: each element's .text()
   * string: that specific attribute's value
 * limit: 500
   * character limit (the detection is called only for the first part of the strings)
 * start: function(){}
   * arguments: as of v1.1: jQuery, options
 * each: function(){}
   * arguments: i, DOMelement, langCode, language, result
   * as of v1.1: i, DOMelement, text, langCode, language, result, options
 * complete: function(){}
   * arguments: array<DOMelement>, array<langCode>, array<language>, array<result>
   * as of v1.1: array<DOMelement>, array<text>, array<langCode>, array<language>, array<result>, options
 * error: function(){}
   * arguments: result.error 

as of v1.1:
 * walk: true
   * true: executes the script on all child elements too, on complex pages this can take time
   * false: translates the given elements' .html(), doesn't get their children, generates more requests
 * returnAll: false
   * true: returns all elements that have been translated (in a jQuery object)
   * false: returns the caller jQuery object
 * not: ''
   * a jquery expr - elements to leave out (script will be omitted either this is set or not)
 * altAndVal: true
   * include alt and :button,:text,:reset's value attribute too (these don't have any textnodes, so they can be processed along with {subject:true})
